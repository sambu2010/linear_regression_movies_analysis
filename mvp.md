# Linear Regression Project - Analysis of movies industry

The goal of this project is to identify which factors affect the movie revenue

In order to do that I will start exploring the data collected from boxofficemojo.com and build a linear model with one feature (budget) showing it in relation to a target (revenue).

The graphic shows a linear model between the budget and domestic revenue. The confidence interval is plotted in light blue.
As we can see the budget has a significant impact of a movie's revenue. However, the spread of residuals tells us that budget is not the only factor that defines the success of the movie. Other factors will be explored as the project goes.
